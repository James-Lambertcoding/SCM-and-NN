This is the repository associated for a project for ECON 189 Big Data and Machine Learning at QMUL.

The contents is orginial work from Group J - James Lambert, Alexander Grant, Anthony Brennan, Lewis Pagden unless otherwised attributed.

The project investigates the use of Machine Learning techniques to produce prediction akin to Synthetic Control Method.

The technics used are 
•	Synthetic Control Methods (implemented in R)
•	Penalised Regression Methods (implemented in Python)
•	Neural Networks (implemented in Python)
